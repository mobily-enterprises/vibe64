# Accounts, connections, and Studio health

People can connect the external accounts needed for agent and repository work
and see whether the Studio host is ready to support them.

## Public contract

The Accounts surface reports required providers, guides supported sign-in, and
keeps credentials in host-owned storage. Studio health performs read-only checks
of workspace access, account readiness, command-line tools, Genesis, and the
managed browser runtime. Failures identify the concrete host capability that is
missing without attempting project-specific repairs.
The managed launcher relies on cgroup v2 CPU accounting and does not assign the
deprecated `CPUAccounting` property. Launcher deprecation output must not precede
version output and make installed runtimes appear unavailable.
The browser check validates the pinned Chromium installation and launches its
headless shell within the bounded health job, rather than starting desktop
browser services. Execution failure reasons take precedence over incidental
browser log messages in the short Health summary.

Account sign-in completion arrives through actor-scoped realtime refresh hints
when available. The hint contains only the session identity and status version;
the browser rereads the protected auth-session endpoint for output and account
state. A bounded fallback check remains available for missed events, but
repeated failures back off instead of keeping the browser in a tight retry
loop.

Account sign-in and sign-out are account-wide operations and do not require a
selected project. Connected Codex status includes the ChatGPT email from the
selected account's local identity token when available, without exposing tokens,
starting a runtime, or changing the authentication generation. Missing identity
metadata and API-key connections remain usable without an email. The connection
surface shows a Disconnect action for connected accounts and sign-in choices for
disconnected accounts.
Codex device sign-in uses a single-column Prepare / Connect flow. The code
and adjacent Copy action share a responsive surface; Continue to ChatGPT is
the primary authorization action. Each step keeps its reference screenshot
behind an optional help disclosure. Copy feedback is announced in place,
code preparation reserves a skeleton region, and Previous step remains secondary.
The settings link and continue action share a wrapping row. Cancel login sits
beside the overall sign-in status, and the terminal uses its existing surface-class
seam for a distinct themed background. Active sign-in replaces disconnected warning chrome
with a neutral status; the existing session polling, authorization URL, API-key
choice and terminal recovery continue to own authentication.
When Codex authentication changes, Vibe64 retires active and
detached owned Codex runtimes before accepting the new account state. It reports
success only after process exit is verified; a runtime that cannot be proven
stopped leaves the account transition visibly unsuccessful rather than allowing
an old credential-bearing process to survive silently.
If isolated temporary runtime removal finishes before thread deletion, cleanup
reconciles the removed runtime's ownership records without reconnecting to its
old account. The same reconciliation works on a later status retry in the
running server. When the shared process has a verified exit and retained exit
proof, a helper already durably marked `cleanup_required` can be detached from
its stopped client without blocking the account transition. Its history and
ownership record remain for the next connection's ordinary cleanup retry; this
does not claim deletion or resume the old account's work. An unverified exit or
failure to persist that cleanup state still fails the transition. A successful
sign-in status refresh clears the earlier login error in the browser.

An ordinary account read automatically retries a persisted `reconnecting`
transition through the same live status and runtime-retirement path, including
after a server restart. Concurrent status readers share that recovery, while
sign-in completion waits for an existing read before checking the new
credentials. Failed retirement leaves the transition pending for a later read;
settled account reads remain local. Recovery happens when account status is
requested, without adding a background timer. A confirmed `reconnect_required`
state still requires a new sign-in.

The assistant-capability service can read the complete provider registry from
the pinned OpenCode runtime without a project or configured provider
credentials. It starts a temporary OpenCode service, gives only native Zen's
non-secret `public` identity so paid definitions are not hidden, reads the
native provider and agent APIs, proves that service stopped, and removes its
private state. Provider data is allowlist-sanitized before caching: consumers
receive exact provider ids, native defaults, safe model capabilities and limits,
definition revisions, and whether Vibe64's one-key connection flow is
compatible, but never raw environment names, credentials, request options,
headers, costs, or upstream connection state. Malformed and empty registries
fail instead of becoming an authoritative empty catalogue.

For OpenCode Zen, Vibe64 also reads Zen's official public `/v1/models` endpoint
and reconciles those current ids with the pinned runtime's complete sanitized
metadata. A newly advertised id missing from that runtime receives only a safe
id-and-label fallback until OpenCode supplies its metadata; an actual key check
still decides whether it works. The bounded request sends no provider
credential, neither catalogue operation reads a saved owner key, and a failed
or malformed response remains a retryable catalogue failure instead of
exposing stale Zen models. This live Zen result shares the existing short-lived
catalogue cache; it is loaded only by explicit full-catalogue operations, never
by opening or creating a session or sending its first message.

The host may contribute redacted connection metadata that marks a connection
as built in, identifies the preferred new-session provider, and restricts it to
one recommended model or a finite enabled-model allowlist. The sanitized
catalogue retains other live model records with a locked status and
host-supplied explanation, while selection resolution and the session selector
expose only available models. A
generic owner-authenticated model-access operation delegates a warned unlock or
relock to the host; a host may reserve more involved account-management actions
for its own management surface. Public Vibe64 does not name a private provider
policy or store provider credentials. Runtime admission remains a separate host
check, so a durable selection cannot bypass a later restriction.

Zen's rotating model roster never makes its saved connection stale. Provider
revision checks still protect connection setup and other provider definitions,
while current Zen ids independently control which models are presented. The
host's recommended Big Pickle entry therefore remains connected and available
when paid models rotate or a prior session selection is no longer enabled.

The short-lived private-credential-free catalogue snapshot is independent of
credential-bearing assistant runtimes. Replacing or removing a connection
still retires those runtimes, but does not discard an unexpired catalogue and
force an otherwise redundant cold discovery.

A host may ask Vibe64 to verify one exact OpenCode provider, model, and API key.
Vibe64 first checks that provider and model against the same current catalogue,
including Zen's live model ids for the native Zen provider, then runs one
finite, tool-free request with a tiny output allowance
in isolated temporary credential storage. Provider rejection is distinct from
a stale catalogue or unavailable managed execution, error details do not expose
the submitted secret, and the temporary credential state is removed on every
outcome. No provider URL override is required: the pinned OpenCode runtime owns
its native provider destinations.

Codex helper-model preferences belong to the connection, outside project source,
at `<systemRoot>/ai-connections/codex-helper-model.json`. An empty model ID means
Recommended and resolves the code default at execution time. Account management
authorization also protects reads and writes of this preference. The account
API offers live models supporting low thinking, rejects unavailable choices,
and preserves unreadable settings instead of replacing them. Each new economy
profile captures the saved choice; existing profiles and the main assistant are
unchanged. The shared Helper model dialog is also available to hosts for their
own connection-owned preferences through an explicit endpoint.
